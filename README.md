## Motivation

I love watching movies, but also I appreciate watching non-commercial movies that are not available in the
large movie chains from Mexico. And my local (goverment-owned) cinema displays some of them, but while looking
for the available movies I see a problem, they publish the listings on their [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/CinetecaEdomex/), or on their
non-responsive, ugly to navigate, lacking of information website.

So this is my solution to my personal problem.
